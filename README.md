# Cardsmith — Digital Business Card Creator

A backend-free digital business card builder. Create a card, customize its theme,
add contact links / social icons / photo gallery / expandable info sections, then
share it as a link or QR code. Everything runs in the browser — nothing to deploy
except static files.

---

## 1. Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **v18 or newer** (v20 recommended)
- npm (comes with Node)
- VS Code (or any editor)

Check your versions in a terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## 2. Install & run (development)

Open this folder in VS Code, then open a terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``) and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL, typically **http://localhost:5173**. Open it in your
browser. Changes to any file under `src/` hot-reload instantly.

---

## 3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

This outputs a fully static site into the `dist/` folder. To confirm it works
before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## 4. Hosting (no backend required)

`dist/` is 100% static HTML/CSS/JS. Deploy it anywhere that serves static files:

- **Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages / GitHub Pages** — drag-and-drop the
  `dist` folder, or connect the repo and set build command `npm run build`,
  output directory `dist`.
- **Your own server** — copy `dist/` to any web server (nginx, Apache, S3 + CDN, etc).
- **Locally** — just double-run `npm run preview`, or open `dist/index.html`
  directly (routing uses `HashRouter` specifically so it also works from a plain
  `file://` path or a sub-folder, with no server rewrite rules needed).

---

## 5. How sharing works without a server

There's no database, so a "shareable link" can't point at a server record.
Instead, the entire card (compressed) is embedded directly in the URL itself,
after `#/view/`. Opening the link decodes the card client-side. This is why:

- Links get long if you add lots of large photos — the app warns you above
  ~2,000 characters and flags it as "large" past ~6,000.
- Anyone with the link can see the card, and the QR code encodes the same
  link, since scanning it just opens that URL.
- Recipients can tap **"Save a copy"** on the view page to store their own
  local copy in their browser, letting them, e.g., re-share or reference it later.

If you later add a real backend, replace `src/utils/share.js` with calls to
your API and store only a short ID in the URL instead.

## 6. Data storage

- **Card data** (all cards you create) is stored in the browser's **IndexedDB**
  (via the `idb` library), scoped to whichever origin/device you're using.
  It does not sync across devices or browsers on its own.
- **Small preferences** use `localStorage`.
- Use **Export card data (JSON)** in the editor to back up a card, and
  **Import JSON** on the home screen to restore/transfer it to another
  browser or device.

  Gradient, Luxury, Corporate) + accent color and font override
- Clickable contact icons: call (copies number + `tel:`), WhatsApp with
  prefilled message, email with subject/body, website, Google Maps, LinkedIn,
  GitHub, Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, Telegram
- Unlimited custom expandable info sections (About, Products, Services, Team,
  FAQs, Testimonials, Portfolio, etc.), each with its own items

- Share via link, Web Share API, WhatsApp, Email, Telegram, or copy-to-clipboard
- Download contact as `.vcf` (imports into phone contacts)
- Export card as PNG, PDF, or print
- Export/import full card data as JSON for backup/transfer
- All data stored locally (IndexedDB); no account, no server
- Fully static — self-hostable anywhere

## 9. Known limitations (by design, since there's no backend)

- A shared link only works if the recipient opens that exact link — there's
  no central database to "look up" a card by short ID.
- Very large images make links long. Keep logos/photos reasonably sized
  (the app doesn't currently auto-compress uploads).
- Cards saved in one browser don't automatically appear in another; use
  JSON export/import to move them.
